# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Breast Cancer Detection using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
In this project, I explored a breast cancer dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify correlations between features and the target variable. A heatmap was used to visualize these relationships. After cleaning and transforming the data with Pandas, I split the dataset and scaled the features. I implemented and compared two models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to predict breast cancer.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
